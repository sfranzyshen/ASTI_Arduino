# ArduinoASTInterpreter
This is the Arduino Library of the ASTInterpreter library. The ASTInterpreter library is a modular system that transforms Arduino/C++ source code into executable command streams through a sophisticated multi-stage processing pipeline. 
It provides full Arduino language support with hardware simulation, making it perfect for educational tools, code validation, and Arduino development environments.
